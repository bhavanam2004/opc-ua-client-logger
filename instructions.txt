Setup and run instructions

This file explains how to set up the simulator and run the data logging program step by step.

System requirements

You need the following:

Windows operating system

Matrikon OPC Simulation Server installed

Python installed on your system

Basic knowledge of running Python programs

Simulator setup

Open Matrikon OPC Explorer.
Check that the simulation server is available with the name Matrikon.OPC.Simulation.1.
Add some simulated tags such as:
Random.Real8
Random.Int4
Bucket Brigade.Real8
Saw-toothed Waves.Real8

Make sure that the tag values are changing in the explorer.

Python environment setup

Open Command Prompt.
Install the required Python libraries by running:
pip install pywin32 pandas

Place the Python program file in a folder where you want to store the output CSV files.

Running the application

Open Command Prompt.
Navigate to the project folder.
Run the program using:
python matrikon_opc_csv_logger.py

The program will start running and reading OPC data automatically.

Output generation

A folder for CSV files is created automatically by the program.
CSV files are generated without manual creation.
One CSV file is created for each hour.
New data rows are added at each read interval.

Example output files:
OPC_Log_2026-01-06_16.csv
OPC_Log_2026-01-06_17.csv

Stopping the program

To stop the program, press CTRL + C in the Command Prompt window.

Important notes

The CSV files should not be created manually.
The program only reads OPC data and does not change any values.
This project is meant for learning and demonstration purposes.
